The new MongoDB Shell (:mongosh:`mongosh </>`) is bundled with package
manager installations of MongoDB Server for Linux and the OSX
``brew`` installer. However, if you use one of the ``tgz``, ``zip``, or ``msi``
packages to install the server, you will need to follow the
:mongosh:`mongosh installation instructions </install>` to download and
install the shell separately.
