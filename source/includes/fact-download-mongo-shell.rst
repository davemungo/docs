The MongoDB Shell (:mongosh:`mongosh </>`) is included as part of the
:doc:`MongoDB server installation </installation>`. If you have already
installed the server, :mongosh:`mongosh </>` is installed in the same
location as the server binary.

install the shell as a standalone package by following these steps:

1. Access the Download Center:

   - `MongoDB Download Center
     <https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/shell>`__

2. Select your preferred :guilabel:`Version` and :guilabel:`Platform`
   from the dropdowns.

3. Select the :guilabel:`Package` to download according to your
   platform:

   .. list-table::
     :header-rows: 1
     :stub-columns: 1
